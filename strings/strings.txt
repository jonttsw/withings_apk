    spo2_detail_description	Oxygen Saturation (or SpO2) reflects the amount of oxygen contained in your red blood cells. Results can vary based on factors such as your health profile, your environment and the way the measurement is done.\n\nIf results consistently fall under 95%, or are associated with symptoms, contact your doctor who will help you make a diagnosis and take preventive actions.
    spo2_detail_description_auto	Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) reflects the amount of oxygen contained in your red blood cells. Results can vary based on factors such as your health profile, your environment and the way the measurement is done.\n\nOxygen saturation is automatically measured during sleep, every 30 minutes. The above result is the average of all those values. It is an indication to help you monitor your oxygen saturation while asleep. Repeated low oxygen saturation levels during sleep could be a sign of pulmonary issues.
    spo2_detail_description_belowAverage	This measurement detects that your blood oxygen level is below average but still normal. The results can vary based on a number of factors including your health profile, your environment and the way the measurement is done. \n\nWe suggest you check for the best pratices and train to improve your gesture.
    spo2_detail_description_inconclusive	Your device could not determine your Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) because of a problem during the measurement. Please check our measurement tutorial to learn how to improve the reading. \n\nA reliable measurement is made while resting at sea level in an unpolluted area, and without having smoked beforehand. You must stay still and not talk during the measurement.
    spo2_detail_description_low	Below 90%, the value can be a possible sign of hypoxemia (low oxygen level in your red blood cells). The results can vary based on a number of factors including your health profile, your environment and the way the measurement is done. \n\nWe suggest you check for the best practices and repeat the measurement. \n\nIn case results in this zone are associated with symptoms, contact your doctor or a health professional who will help you make a diagnosis and take preventive actions.

    wbs_article_visceral_fat_004	This is the type of fat most linked to health problems.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_005	Maintaining healthy levels of visceral fat can help reduce cardiovascular risks, high blood pressure and the onset of type 2 diabetes.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_006	What’s the difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat?
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_007	Visceral fat and subcutaneous fat are two different types of fat.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_008	Subcutaneous fat is a type of fat that is stored just under the skin. It\'s the fat you can easily pinch between your fingers.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_009	However, visceral fat is located behind the abdominal muscles and cannot be seen. It surrounds the stomach, liver, intestines and other organs.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_010	What results can I get?
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_011	The level of visceral fat in the body is measured by what we call the Visceral Fat Index, which ranges from 1 (lowest) to 20 (highest).
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_012	A Visceral Fat Index from 1 to 5 (included) indicates you have a normal level of visceral fat. Continue monitoring your score over time to ensure it stays within the normal range. Regular activity can help reduce your visceral fat score.
    wbs_article_visceral_fat_013	A Visceral Fat Index from 5 to 20 indicates you have a high level of visceral fat. Implementing a healthy diet and frequent activity can help reduce the visceral fat score.
